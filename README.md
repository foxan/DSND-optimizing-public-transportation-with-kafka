# DSND-optimizing-public-transportation-with-kafka
Construct a streaming event pipeline around Apache Kafka and its ecosystem, using public data from the Chicago Transit Authority

### Overview
In this project, you will construct a streaming event pipeline around Apache Kafka and its ecosystem. Using public data from the [Chicago Transit Authority](https://www.transitchicago.com/data/) we will construct an event pipeline around Kafka that allows us to simulate and display the status of train lines in real time.

When the project is complete, you will be able to monitor a website to watch trains move from station to station. So a sample static view of the website page you create might look like this:

### Prerequisites
To complete your project locally, the following are required:

- Docker
- Python 3.7
- A minimum of 16gb+ RAM and a 4-core CPU on your computer to execute the simulation

Alternatively, you may complete the project entirely in the Project Workspace we provide.
